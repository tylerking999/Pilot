Copy/paste this to your Fiverr order:

---

### PROJECT BRIEF

**App Name:** Pilot

**App Purpose:** AI-powered mental wellness companion that generates personalized daily tasks based on your mood. Helps users build streaks and develop positive momentum.

**Target Audience:** 18-34 year olds seeking mental health support, daily structure, and emotional wellness. Mass market appeal.

**Platform:** iOS (iPhone)

**Vibe/Personality:**
- Supportive and gentle (not clinical)
- Modern and trustworthy
- Hopeful and encouraging
- Tech-forward but warm

---

### DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

**Format:**
- 1024x1024px PNG (primary deliverable)
- All iOS sizes generated (or I can do this with appicon.co)
- No transparency on main icon
- RGB color mode

**Style Preferences:**
- Clean, modern, minimal
- Works at small sizes (60x60px on home screen)
- NO text or words
- NO gradients that "mud out" when scaled down
- Recognizable and unique

**Must Work On:**
- White background (light mode)
- Black background (dark mode)
- Home screen at 60px
- App Store at 1024px

---

### COLOR PALETTE

**Primary Color:** `#7C3AED` (Purple)
**Secondary Colors:**
- Gray: `#9CA3AF` (Drained mood)
- Red: `#EF4444` (Restless mood)
- Green: `#10B981` (Hopeful mood)
- Amber: `#F59E0B` (Scattered mood)

**Background:** `#0F172A` (Dark navy)

---

### DESIGN CONCEPT (My Preference)

**Concept: "Mood Circles"**

Four overlapping circles representing our 4 mood states:
- Arranged in a gentle arc/smile shape
- Each circle is a different color (gray, red, green, amber)
- Overlapping creates subtle blend effects
- On purple background
- Clean, geometric, modern

**Why this concept:**
- Instantly communicates the mood tracking feature
- Colorful and eye-catching
- Unique and ownable
- Scales well to small sizes

**Alternative acceptable concepts:**
- Abstract "P" made from a path/journey line with forward momentum
- Stylized compass pointing upward (guidance/direction)
- Brain outline with heart center (emotional intelligence)

**Please provide 2-3 initial concepts for me to choose from.**

---

### INSPIRATION REFERENCES

**Apps I Like:**
- Daylio (colorful mood circles - but make it more sophisticated)
- Notion (clean geometric simplicity)
- Calm (professional gradient work)

**Apps to Differentiate From:**
- Headspace (don't use orange)
- Todoist (don't use pure red)
- Habitica (don't use game/RPG style)

---

### DELIVERABLES

**Must Include:**
1. 1024x1024px PNG (final icon)
2. 2-3 initial concepts to choose from
3. 1 round of revisions included
4. Source file (AI, PSD, or Figma)

**Optional but Appreciated:**
- All iOS sizes pre-generated
- Alternative color variations
- Dark mode optimized version

---

### TIMELINE

**Needed By:** [Insert your date - suggest 3-5 days]

**My Response Time:** I can review concepts within 12 hours and provide feedback same day.

---

### FEEDBACK PROCESS

1. Show me 2-3 initial concepts
2. I'll choose one and provide specific feedback
3. One round of revisions
4. Final delivery

---

### BUDGET

**Budget:** $30-50 (adjust based on seller's pricing)

**Willing to pay extra for:**
- Fast delivery (24-48 hours)
- Multiple revisions
- Source files

---

### WHAT I DON'T WANT

‚ùå Generic/stock icon templates
‚ùå Overly complex designs with too much detail
‚ùå Photorealistic images
‚ùå Childish or cartoon style
‚ùå Text or words
‚ùå Anything that looks like existing mental health apps

---

### ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

**About Pilot:**
- Users check in daily with their mood
- AI generates one personalized task
- Track streaks and build momentum
- Chat with AI for support
- View insights and patterns

**Key Differentiator:** Mood-based AI task generation (not just a habit tracker or journal)

**Brand Positioning:** Somewhere between a mental health app (like Calm) and a productivity app (like Notion). Professional but warm. Tech-forward but human.

---

### QUESTIONS FOR DESIGNER

1. How many initial concepts will you provide?
2. How many revisions are included?
3. Can you deliver all iOS sizes or just the 1024x1024?
4. What's your typical turnaround time?
5. Will you provide source files?

---

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ Make someone pause while scrolling the App Store
‚úÖ Communicate "mental wellness + AI" at a glance
‚úÖ Look professional and polished
