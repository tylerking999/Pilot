## üéØ CRITICAL PATH TO LAUNCH (Must-Haves)

### 4. ‚ö°Ô∏è MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES

#### A. Voice Mode (Mentioned in Tiers but Not Implemented)
**Current:** Voice features promised but not built
**Fix Options:**
1. **Remove from free/pro tiers** - Simplify for v1.0
2. **Implement basic version:**
   - Use iOS Speech framework for transcription
   - Use ElevenLabs API (key already configured) for TTS
   - Add voice button in HomeView
   - Voice conversation = chat with voice I/O

**Recommendation:** Remove voice for v1.0, add in v1.1 update

#### B. Data Export (Promised in Premium)
```swift
// Add to SettingsView.swift
func exportData() async {
    let entries = await storage.getEntries()
    let jsonData = try? JSONEncoder().encode(entries)
    // Share as .json file via share sheet
}
```

#### C. Weekly Insights Generation
**Current:** InsightsView shows stats but no AI-generated summary
**Fix:**
```swift
// Add to InsightsView
Button("Generate Weekly Insight") {
    Task {
        let insight = try await aiService.generateWeeklyInsights(
            entries: appState.getRecentEntries(limit: 7)
        )
        weeklyInsight = insight
    }
}
